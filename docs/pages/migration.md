# Migration

<p class="uk-text-lead">Migrate an existing UIkit website to the latest version.</p>

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.17 to 3.18

If you have created a custom UIkit style, and overridden a `*-color-mode` variable, make sure it is set to either `light` or `dark`. It can no longer be set to `none` or be empty. 

UIkit 3.18 introduces new `*-color-mode` Less variables for the default and muted style modifiers in Section, Tile, Card and Overlay components, just like for the primary and secondary style modifiers. Since the default UIkit style has light backgrounds, their color mode variables are set to dark by default. If you have a dark custom UIkit style where the color mode variables change to the opposite color, you also have to change the new color mode variables to light.

```
// For dark UIkit styles only 

@card-default-color-mode: light;

@overlay-default-color-mode: light;

@section-default-color-mode: light;
@section-muted-color-mode: light;

@tile-default-color-mode: light;
@tile-muted-color-mode: light;
```

## Migration from UIkit 3.16 to 3.17

The [Scroll component](scroll.md) now automatically adds the height of a sticky element, for example the sticky navbar, as offset to the scroll target so it is not covered by the sticky element. If there is already an offset for a sticky element, the `offset` option is added up. This means that you don't have to set the offset option to prevent the navbar from covering the scroll target anymore.

The [Grid component](grid.md) now has a new masonry `pack` mode which will sort items into columns with the most room. To keep backward compatibility, setting masonry to `true`, will just use the new `pack` mode. To show items in their natural order, as before, use the `next` mode.

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.15 to 3.16

UIkit 3.16 simplifies some classes in the [Drop component](drop.md). Update your markup by replacing the following classes.

| Class                      | Replace with    |
| -------------------------- | --------------- |
| `uk-dropdown-close`        | `uk-drop-close` |
| `uk-dropdown-grid`         | `uk-drop-grid`  |
| `uk-navbar-dropdown-close` | `uk-drop-close` |
| `uk-navbar-dropdown-grid`  | `uk-drop-grid`  |

The Dropdown, Dropbar and Navbar Dropdown CSS is now based on the Drop component. Therefore, they have no longer individual `z-index` Less variables. If you have used one of those variables in a custom UIkit theme, you have to replace them.

| Less variable              | Replace with               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `@dropdown-z-index`        | `@drop-z-index`            |
| `@dropbar-z-index`         | `@drop-z-index`            |
| `@navbar-dropdown-z-index` | `@drop-z-index`            |

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.14 to 3.15

The [Nav component](nav.md) in UIkit 3.15 now uses a JavaScript component to create the parent icon for a nav item instead of compiling the parent icon into the CSS. Just search for the `.uk-nav-parent-icon` class and remove it from the markup. Simply use a `span` with the `uk-nav-parent-icon` attribute for each nav item with children instead. Here is a quick example.

```
<ul class="uk-nav-default" uk-nav>
    <li class="uk-parent">
        <a href="#">Parent <span uk-nav-parent-icon></span></a>
        <ul class="uk-nav-sub">â€¦</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
```

### Drop, Dropdown and Navbar Dropdown

The [Drop component](drop.md), [Dropdown component](dropdown.md) and [Navbar component](navbar.md) components remove alignment `*-justify` from the `pos` option. Search for `pos: top-justify`, `pos: bottom-justify`, `pos: left-justify` and `pos: right-justify` and use the new  `stretch` option instead.

| Option                | Replace with                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `pos: top-justify`    | `pos: top-left; stretch: x`    |
| `pos: bottom-justify` | `pos: bottom-left; stretch: x` |
| `pos: left-justify`   | `pos: left-top; stretch: y`    |
| `pos: right-justify`  | `pos: right-top; stretch: y`   |

The `boundary-align` option is also removed. Search for `boundary: SELECTOR` in combination with `boundary-align: true` and use the new `target` option with the same selector from `boundary` instead.

| Option                                     | Replace with       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| `boundary: SELECTOR; boundary-align: true` | `target: SELECTOR` |

The `flip` option is split into two options `flip` and `shift`. Update the options as follows.

| Option        | Replace with                |
| ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `flip: false` | `flip: false; shift: false` |

If the Position is `top-*` or `bottom-*`:

| Option    | Replace with   |
| --------- | -------------- |
| `flip: x` | `flip: false`  |
| `flip: y` | `shift: false` |

If the Position is `left-*` or `right-*`:

| Option    | Replace with   |
| --------- | -------------- |
| `flip: x` | `shift: false` |
| `flip: y` | `flip: false`  |

The `display` option is removed. Use `auto-update` instead.

| Option             | Replace with         |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `display: static`  | `auto-update: false` |
| `display: dynamic` | `auto-update: true`  |

### Navbar Dropbar

We removed the style from the dropbar in the Navbar component and now use the new Dropbar component instead. This is why the Navbar component sets `.uk-dropbar` and `.uk-dropbar-top` in addition to the `.uk-navbar-dropbar` class. If you placed the dropbar markup manually, you need to add those classes yourself.

In Less we have removed the `@navbar-dropbar-background` variable, so to set a background, use the `@dropbar-background` variable instead. Make sure to add any further style you applied to the navbar dropbar as well.

### Less Variables

The following Less variables are also renamed. Just find and replace these Less variables if you are using a custom Less theme.

| Less variable                            | Replace with                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `@offcanvas-bar-width-m`                 | `@offcanvas-bar-width-s`                  |
| `@offcanvas-bar-padding-vertical-m`      | `@offcanvas-bar-padding-vertical-s`       |
| `@offcanvas-bar-padding-horizontal-m`    | `@offcanvas-bar-padding-horizontal-s`     |
| `@nav-primary-item-font-size`            | `@nav-primary-font-size`                  |
| `@nav-primary-item-line-height`          | `@nav-primary-line-height`                |
| `@navbar-dropdown-dropbar-margin-top`    | `@navbar-dropdown-dropbar-padding-top`    |
| `@navbar-dropdown-dropbar-margin-bottom` | `@navbar-dropdown-dropbar-padding-bottom` |

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.13 to 3.14

UIkit 3.14 renames the `top` and `bottom` options to `start` and `end` in the [Sticky component](sticky.md).

| Option   | Replace with |
| -------- | ------------ |
| `top`    | `start`      |
| `bottom` | `end`        |

It also deprecates the `position: auto` option from the [Sticky component](sticky.md). Simply use the new `overflow-flip: true` options instead.

| Option           | Replace with          |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| `position: auto` | `overflow-flip: true` |

## Migration from UIkit 3.11 to 3.12

UIkit 3.12 deprecates `uk-img` from the [Image component](image.md) for the `<img>` element. Simply use the native `loading="lazy"` attribute instead. This also applies if `uk-img` is used to target adjacent slides within Slideshows or Sliders. Both components, Slideshow and Slider, work with lazy loading images out of the box.

| Attribute | Replace with     |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| `uk-img`  | `loading="lazy"` |

**Important** This change also requires `<img>` elements to have `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shifts.

## Migration from UIkit 3.10 to 3.11

UIkit 3.11 adds new `start` and `end` options to the [Parallax component](parallax.md) and deprecates the `viewport` option. Replace the `viewport` option with the `end` option. Simply calculate `1` minus your viewport value and multiply it by `100vh + 100%`. Here are some examples:

| Viewport Value | End Value    |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `0.6`          | `40vh + 40%` |
| `0.5`          | `50vh + 50%` |
| `0.3`          | `70vh + 70%` |

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.4 to 3.5

In UIkit 3.5 all Less variables and class names which have `xxlarge` in their name got renamed to `2xlarge` for better consistency. Just find and replace these Less variables if you are using a custom Less theme. There is just one class in the [Width component](width.md) which has to be updated in your markup.

| Class              | Replace with       |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `uk-width-xxlarge` | `uk-width-2xlarge` |


***

## Migration from UIkit 3.2 to 3.3

UIkit 3.3 adds a new `uk-container-xlarge` class to the [Container component](container.md) with a width of `1600px` as default value. This is why the class `uk-container-large` changes its width from `1600px` to `1400px`. Update your markup by replacing the following classes.

| Class                | Replace with          |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `uk-container-large` | `uk-container-xlarge` |

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.1 to 3.2

### Text Component

Since UIkit 3.2 adds a new `uk-text-bolder` class to the [Text component](text.md), the class `uk-text-bold` now applies literally a `bold` font weight instead of `bolder`. The `@text-bold-font-weight` variable, which was set to `bolder`, got removed.

***

## Migration from UIkit 3.0 to 3.1

UIkit 3.1 adds the `@deprecated` Less variable. By default, it is set to `false`, and deprecated classes are not compiled into the CSS.

If you want to update your markup later and use the deprecated classes along the new ones, set the variable to `true` in your custom UIkit theme.

```
@deprecated: true;
```

### Heading Component

The Primary and Hero classes in the [Heading component](heading.md) are deprecated. Update your markup by replacing the following classes.

| Class                | Replace with        |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| `uk-heading-primary` | `uk-heading-medium` |
| `uk-heading-hero`    | `uk-heading-xlarge` |

***

## Migration from UIkit 2 to 3

Uikit 3 offers a migration tool that runs in your browser and lists all necessary changes from an existing <a href="https://getuikit.com/v2/">Uikit 2 site</a>. Two options are available to run the tool: Via a bookmark or by including a single JavaScript file. The necessary migration changes are then listed in your browser's console.

### Browser bookmark

The easiest way to use the migration tool is via a bookmark in your browser. You can then run the script on any page that you navigate to by simply clicking the bookmark. Just drag the following link into your browser's bookmark section.

Drag into your bookmark bar <span uk-icon="icon: arrow-right"></span> <a class="uk-button uk-button-primary" href="javascript: (function () { var script = document.createElement('script'); script.setAttribute('src', 'https://getuikit.com/migrate.min.js'); document.body.appendChild(script); }());">UIkit 3 Migration</a>

Alternatively, you can manually create a bookmark with the following code as its URL.

```js
javascript: (function () {
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.setAttribute('src', 'https://getuikit.com/migrate.min.js');
    document.body.appendChild(script);
}());
```

### HTML integration

You can also run the migration tool by loading the needed JavaScript on your website. This way the migration script will always be loaded on your website. Remember to remove this when you have completed the migration. Add the following line just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script src="https://getuikit.com/migrate.min.js"></script>
```

### Usage

To start the migration, replace the UIkit 2 files of your website with their UIkit 3 equivalents (both JS and CSS) and run the migration tool using one of the solutions listed above. To learn how to change your markup, open the developer console of your browser. Your see a list of warnings and notices that tell you what to change. You can click the arrows next to any message to see more details about the necessary changes.

![Console output](images/migration-console.gif)

Every notice or warning message tells you what to change, including a list of all affected HTML elements. More complex changes are explained with examples that are easy to follow. The best way to migrate is to fix one component after another. That way you can see if the error messages are gone after a page reload and also see the changes on your site.

### Warnings

Warnings highlight all CSS classes or JavaScript attributes which are not supported anymore or have changed in UIkit 3. These warnings have to be fixed to migrate your website to UIkit 3.

### Notices

Notices highlight potential issues that might not break your site. Some notices might not require a change at all. This is caused by the fact that some names from UIkit 2 still exist in UIkit 3, but now belong to a different component or carry different semantics. This can't be detected by the selectors we use to determine if this is a correct markup, so you need to take a look into it and need to decide if you already have changed it or still need to fix it.
